Freeriding is certainly spectacular. I was able to work for numerous brands taking pictures of these young riders, attracted by the performance, but also by a real lifestyle.

Much like surfers, many freeriders I know were attracted by the beauty of mountains and a philosophy promoting the respect of nature.
