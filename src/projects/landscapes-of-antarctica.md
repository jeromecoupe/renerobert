Those pictures have more of a poetic or artistic feeling to them than the rest of the photos I took during those periods. I didn't retouch any of them, wanting to stay as close as possible to the mystical beauty of Antarctica.

These pictures are the best way I found to share my feeling as a small human confronted with the majesty of that environment. Being featured in several exhibitions around the world allowed me to share these unique moments with others.
