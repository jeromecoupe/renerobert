These pictures are all part of a few collaborations with Rossignol, both when they launched mountain clothing imagined by Emilio Pucci and Jean-Charles de Castelbajac when we worked together on the "Compagnie des guide de Chamonix" collection.

The close collaboration we had on these projects is something I look for in all the brands I have worked with over the years.
