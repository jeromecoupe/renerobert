    caption: This glass has been coated  to be nearly as transparent as my camera lens. I must say I am impressed by the near invisibility of the cube.

Following such an unusual project from start to finish was a great opportunity to take some really stunning pictures.

I could also access some parts of the Aiguille du Midi that very few people have seen, like the Northern rocky outcrop full of antennas. One of the highest European television relays.
