After having done his crossing of the Antarctic, Alain decided to try to replicate the adventure, but this time in the Arctic.

For the Arctic Arc expedition, Alain and Dixie Dansecoer planned to cross the Arctic from Russia to Greenland via the North Pole. That means they were both pulling very heavy sledges containing all they needed to survive during roughly two months.

These expeditions were sponsored by Compaq and Rolex, which means I was also in charge of providing branding and marketing material for those brands.
