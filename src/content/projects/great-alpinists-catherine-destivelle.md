I have witnessed several of her solitary ascents for Paris Match. I even accompanied her to Himalaya, where I had to climb with her in order to take some pictures. She was quite difficult to follow at time, believe me.

We became really good friends over the years. I guess sharing so many wonderful memories helped a little.
