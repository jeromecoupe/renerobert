I spent several seasons in Antarctica, accompanying the construction team and doing my share of work as part of the team on top of taking pictures.

Although nobody was skying or mountaineering, this remains one the most extreme adventure I ever took part in. The team was working around the clock to get the building up before the return of the Antarctic winter.

I still vividly remember the moment when the main building was completed. The feeling of relief and accomplishment of every member of the team was quite palpable. We made it!
