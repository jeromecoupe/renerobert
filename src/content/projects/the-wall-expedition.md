The team for the first ascent of Holtanna: Alain Hubert (Belgium), Ralph Dujmovits (Germany), André Georges (Switzerland), Fabrizzio Zangrilli (U.S.), and Daniel Mercier and René Robert (France). Also with us was Katelijne Vanheulekom (Belgium), in charge of communications with headquarters, and scientists Alain Bidart (France) and Ronald Ross (U.S.), who were working on different education and research projects.

I will always remember those nights we spent in the portaledge, attached to the mountain. What a first encounter with Antarctica!
