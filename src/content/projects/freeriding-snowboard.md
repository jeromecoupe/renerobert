As a young photographer, I had the opportunity to work with Thierry Donard from the "Nuits de la Glisse". For the next 30 years, I met and worked with every new generation of riders. Many of them have become close friends.

Don't tell anyone but, even today, Thierry and I will still go out and follow a few rides, just for the fun.

I am so grateful to all these riders who worked with me to transmit their passion and energy. They are the artists, I am just someone with a camera and a passion for photography who happened to be at the right spot at the right time.
