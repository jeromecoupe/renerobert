Jean-Marc Boivin was one of the best climbers of his generation. I got to follow him around the world during about ten years. Although I am nearly 50 now, I still owe him a lot of wonderful memories.

On top of being an exceptional climbers, Jean-Marc was also really into base jump, hang-gliders and parachute. Early in his career, he decided that those were the best way to come down of a mountain after climbing on top of it.

He died in 1990 in Venezuela, trying to rescue an injured base-jumper by jumping himself. He has been missed by all of us ever since.
