When collecting the pictures I wanted to showcase on this website, I came across a few mountaineering pictures I absolutely wanted to share with you.

As you might have noticed, mountaineering and mountains themselves have always played a very special role throughout my career. I feel so blessed to be a witness of the beauty of mountains and the stubbornness and determination mankind has shown to reach their summits.
