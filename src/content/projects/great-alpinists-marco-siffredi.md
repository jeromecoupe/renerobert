I met Marco when he was 16. He could have been my son but I like to think of myself as a big brother of some kind, even though he real brother died when he was 3.

Reinhold Messner said that Marco did the best Everest ascent of all times, followed by the first ever descent by snowboard of Everest in 2001. On year later, he died on the same mountain, attempting the descent via the Horbein corridor.
