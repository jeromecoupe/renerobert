Around the year 2000, I started to plan a few mineralogy trips with my friend Stéphane Dan.

During eight consecutive summers, we would scour the mountains searching for quartz crystals. We eventually got lucky a couple of times and found a few little treasures.

Most of our findings can now be seen by everybody at the crystals museum in Chamonix, but I will always remember our crystal hunts in the mountains.
